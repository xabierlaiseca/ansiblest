# ansiblest

Ansiblest is a test framework for running ansible tests.

## Running tests

To be able to run the tests, you would need to install the dependencies listed on `requirements/dev.txt`. You can
install them by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

Once you have all required dependencies, you can run all test by executing `run-tests.sh` script.
